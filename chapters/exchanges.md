# Exchange Adapters

## General

Exchanges are each integrated into the Melon protocol through exchange adapter contracts. Exchange adapter contracts each inherit from the standard contract ExchangeAdapter.sol. Each adapter then maps this functionality to the specific exchange contract's defined functionality, overriding the base contract's public methods.
&nbsp;

## ExchangeAdapter.sol

#### Description

The ExchangeAdapter contract intended to generalize the implementation of any concrete exchange adapter.

The function parameter signatures for the functions `makeOrder()`, `takeOrder()` and `cancelOrder()` are identical. The parameters are summarized here:

`address targetExchange` - The address of the intended exchange contract pertaining to the order.

`address[6] orderAddresses` - An array containing address pertaining as per below to the order.
  `orderAddresses[0]` - The address of the order maker.
  `orderAddresses[1]` - The address of the order taker.
  `orderAddresses[2]` - The address of the maker asset token contract.
  `orderAddresses[3]` - The address of the taker asset token contract.
  `orderAddresses[4]` - The address of the fee recipient, `feeRecipientAddress`.
  `orderAddresses[5]` - The address of the sender, `msg.sender`.

`uint[8] orderValues` - An array containing values pertaining as per below to the order.
  `orderValues[0]` - The maker asset quantity.
  `orderValues[1]` - The taker asset quantity.
  `orderValues[2]` - The maker fee.
  `orderValues[3]` - The taker fee.
  `orderValues[4]` - The expiration time of the order in seconds.
  `orderValues[5]` - The salt/nonce used to differentiate orders of like assets and quantities.
  `orderValues[6]` - The order fill quantity, i.e. the quantity of the taker asset token traded.
  `orderValues[7]` - The signature mode specific to the Dexy exchange.

`bytes32 identifier` - The order identifier.

`bytes makerAssetData` - Encoded data specific to the maker asset.

`bytes takerAssetData` - Encoded data specific to the taker asset.

`bytes signature` - The signature of the order maker.

`function takeOrder(
    address targetExchange,
    address[6] orderAddresses,
    uint[8] orderValues,
    bytes32 identifier,
    bytes makerAssetData,
    bytes takerAssetData,
    bytes signature)
onlyManager notShutDown`

Please see parameter descriptions above.

This public function must ensure that:

  the fund is not shut down,
  the `msg.sender` is the fund manager.
  take fill quantity is equal to the taker asset quantity,
  asset tokens to be traded are approved (if required),
  the swap on Uniswap exchange contract is performed,
  the acquired asset token, if not already held, is added to `ownedAssets`. Finally, the acquired asset tokens are returned to the Melon fund's vault and the order status is updated.

The function executes a swap function on the Uniswap exchange contract specifying the assets to swap and the corresponding quantities. The makerAssetAmount (orderAddresses [2]) functions as a minimum acceptable quantity of token acquired in the swap. Finally, the function returns acquired token assets to the fund's vault and updates the fund's internal order tracking.

`function getInputPrice(
    address targetExchange,
    address nativeAsset,
    address srcToken,
    uint srcAmount,
    address destToken)
view returns (uint expectedDestAmount)`

This public view function returns the expected quantity of destToken in return for the srcAmount of srcToken as returned by the Uniswap exchange contract.
&nbsp;

`function dispatchSwap(
    address targetExchange,
    address srcToken,
    uint srcAmount,
    address destToken,
    uint minDestAmount)
internal
    returns (uint actualReceiveAmount)`

This internal function routes the call logic depending on the asset tokens involved. The three possibilities are:

  Fund trades ETH for other asset token - call made to `swapNativeAssetToToken()`
  Fund trades other asset token for ETH - call made to `swapTokenToNativeAsset()`
  Fund trades non-ETH tokens - call made to `swapTokenToToken()`

The function takes the following parameters:

`targetExchange` - The address of the intended exchange contract (i.e. the Uniswap Exchange).
`srcToken` - The address of the asset token the fund will deliver.
`srcAmount` - The quantity of delivering asset token.
`destToken` - The address of the asset token the fund will receive.
`minRate` - The minimum acceptable quantity of the receiving asset token.

The function returns the quantity of the asset token to be received by the fund.

`function swapNativeAssetToToken(
    address targetExchange,
    address nativeAsset,
    uint srcAmount,
    address destToken,
    uint minDestAmount)
internal
    returns (uint receivedAmount)`

This internal function initiates the trade where the Melon fund delivers ETH for the receiving asset token specified by the `destToken` address parameter. The function withdraws the specified quantity of ETH from the fund's vault sends the ETH quantity to the Uniswap exchange contract calling its `ethToTokenSwapInput()` function.

The function takes the following parameters:

`targetExchange` - The address of the intended exchange contract (i.e. the Uniswap exchange).
`nativeAsset` - The address of the native asset token the fund will deliver, ETH.
`srcAmount` - The quantity of delivering asset token.
`destToken` - The address of the asset token the fund will receive.
`minDestAmount` - The minimum acceptable quantity of the receiving asset token.

The function returns the quantity of the `destToken` received. The Uniswap exchange contract function transfers the asset to this (adapter) contract, where it is then transferred back to the vault in the `takeOrder` function.
&nbsp;

`function swapTokenToNativeAsset(
    address targetExchange,
    address srcToken,
    uint srcAmount,
    address nativeAsset,
    uint minDestAmount)
internal
    returns (uint receivedAmount)`

This internal function initiates the trade where the Melon fund delivers the asset token specified by the `srcToken` address parameter for receiving ETH. The function withdraws the specified quantity of the delivery asset token from the fund's vault and sends the quantity to the Uniswap exchange contract calling its `tokenToEthSwapInput()` function. The function then approves the transfer quantity for the exchange. Finally, the function converts any ETH received to WETH.

The function takes the following parameters:

  `targetExchange` - The address of the intended exchange contract (i.e. the Uniswap exchange).
  `srcToken` - The address of the asset token the fund will deliver.
  `srcAmount` - The quantity of delivering asset token.
  `nativeAsset` - The address of the native asset token the fund will receive, ETH.
  `minDestAmount` - The minimum acceptable quantity of the receiving asset token.

The function returns the quantity of the `nativeAsset` received, ETH. The Uniswap exchange contract function transfers the asset to this (adapter) contract, where it is then transferred back to the vault in the `takeOrder` function.
&nbsp;

`function swapTokenToToken(
    address targetExchange,
    address srcToken,
    uint srcAmount,
    address destToken,
    uint minRate)
internal
    returns (uint receivedAmount)`

This internal function initiates the trade where the Melon fund delivers the asset token specified by the `srcToken` address parameter for receiving the asset token specified by the `destToken` address parameter. The function withdraws the specified quantity of the delivery asset token from the fund's vault and sends the quantity to the Uniswap exchange contract calling its `tokenToTokenSwapInput()` function. The function then approves the transfer quantity for the exchange. Finally, the function converts any ETH received to WETH.

The function takes the following parameters:

  `targetExchange` - The address of the intended exchange contract (i.e. the Uniswap exchange).
  `srcToken` - The address of the asset token the fund will deliver.
  `srcAmount` - The quantity of delivering asset token.
  `destToken` - The address of the asset token the fund will receive.
  `minDestAmount` - The minimum acceptable quantity of the receiving asset token (`destToken`).

The function returns the quantity of the `destToken` received. The Uniswap exchange contract function transfers the asset to this (adapter) contract, where it is then transferred back to the vault in the `takeOrder` function.
