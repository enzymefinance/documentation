# Fees

### General

Fees are charges levied against a Melon fund's assets for:
  - management services rendered, in the form of Management Fees
  - fund performance achieved, in the form of Performance Fees

The Management Fee and Performance Fee are each represented by an individual contract. The business logic and functionality of each fee is defined within the respective contract. The contract will interact with the various components of the fund to calculate and return the quantity of shares to create. This quantity is then added to the Manager address balance and to the total supply balance.  

The Fee Manager component manages the individual fee contracts which have been configured for the Melon fund at set up. The core of the Fee Manager is an array of Fee contract instances. Functions exist to prime this array at fund setup with the selected and configured fee contracts, as well as basic query functionality to aid the user interface in calculating and representing the share NAV.

Fees are calculated and allocated when fund actions such as subscribe, redeem or claim fees are executed by a participant. Calling `rewardAllFees()` will iterate over the array of registered fees in the fee manager, calling each fee's calculation logic. This gets the quantity of shares to create and allocate to the manager.

It is important to note that fee calculations take place before the fund's share quantity is impacted by subscriptions or redemptions. To this end, when a subscription or redemption action is initiated by an investor, the execution order first calculates fee amounts and creates the corresponding share quantity, as the elapsed time and share quantity at the start is known. Essentially, the Melon fund calculates and records a reconciled state immediately and in the same transaction where share quantity changes due subscription/redemption.

##### Management Fees

Management Fees are earned with the passage of time, irrespective of performance. The order of fee calculations is important. The Management Fee share quantity calculation is a prerequisite to the Performance Fee calculation, as fund performance must be reduced by the Management Fee expense to fairly ascertain net performance.

The Management Fee calculation business logic is fully encapsulated by the Management Fee contract. This logic can be represented as follows.

First, the time-weighted, pre-dilution share quantity is calculated:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;PD_{f}$=($S_{e-1}$)($\frac{t_{e}}{t_{y}}$)($f_{m}$)"/>

then, this figure is scaled such that investors retain their original share holdings quantity, but newly created shares represent the commensurate fee percentage amount:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;SMF_{e}=\frac{(PD_{f})(S_{e-1})}{S_{e-1}-PD_{f}}$"/>


where,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;PD_{f}"/> = pre-dilution quantity of shares

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;SMF_{e}$"/> = number shares to create to compensate Management Fees earned during the conversion period

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;S_{e-1}$"/> = shares outstanding at the beginning of the conversion period

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;t_{e}$"/> = number of seconds elapsed since previous conversion event

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;t_{y}$"/> = number of seconds in a year ( = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;f_{m}$"/> = Management Fee rate


##### Performance Fees

Performance Fees accrue over time with performance, but can only be harvested after regular, pre-determined points in time. This period is referred to as the Measurement Period and is decided by the fund manager and configured at fund set up.

Performance is assessed at the end of the Measurement Period by comparing the fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) to the fund's current high-water mark (HWM).

The HWM represents the highest share NAV which the Melon fund has historically achieved _at a Measurement Period ending time_. More clearly, it is not a fund all-time-high, but rather the maximum share NAV of all Measurement Period end snapshots.

If the difference to the HWM is positive, performance has been achieved and a Performance Fee is due to the fund manager. This calculation is straightforward and is the aforementioned difference multiplied by the Performance Fee rate. The Performance Fee is _not_ an annualized fee rate.

The calculation of the Performance Fee requires that, at that moment, no Management Fees are due. This will be true as the code structure always invokes the Management Fee calculation and allocation immediately preceding, and in the same transaction, the Performance Fee calculation.

The Performance Fee calculation business logic is fully encapsulated by the Performance Fee contract. This logic can be represented as follows.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?HWM_{MP}$=\begin{cases}GAV_{MF},&GAV_{MF}>HWM_{MP-1}\\HWM_{MP-1},&GAV_{MF}\leq{HWM_{MP-1}}\end{cases}"/>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P_{MP}$=\begin{cases}GAV_{MF}-HWM_{MP-1},&GAV_{MF}>HWM_{MP-1}\\0,&GAV_{MF}\leq{HWM_{MP-1}}\end{cases}"/>


&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?PD_{f}=\frac{(P_{MP})(S_{e-1}+SMF_{e})^2(f_{p})}{GAV}$"/>

&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?SPF_{e}=\frac{(PD_{f})(S_{e-1}+SMF_{e})}{(S_{e-1}+SMF_{e})-PD_{f}}$"/>

where,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?PD_{f}$"/> = pre-dilution quantity of shares

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P_{MP}$"/> = performance for the Measurement Period

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?HWM_{MP}$"/> = high-water mark for the Measurement Period

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?GAV$"/> = current Gross Asset Value per share


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?GAV_{MF}$"/> = current Gross Asset Value per share  net of Management Fee

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f_{p}$"/> = Performance Fee rate

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?S_{e-1}$"/> = shares outstanding after adding Management Fee shares

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?SMF_{e}$"/> = number shares to create to compensate Management Fees earned during the conversion period

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?SPF_{e}$"/> = number shares to create to compensate Performance Fees earned during the conversion period


While Performance Fees are only crystalized at the end of each measurement period, there must be a mechanism whereby redeeming investors compensate for _their_ current share of accrued performance fees prior to redemption.

In the case where an investor redeems prior to the current Measurement Period's end and where the current share price exceeds the fund HWM, a Performance Fee is due. The Redemption business logic calculates the accrued Performance Fee for the entire fund at the time of redemption and weights this by the redemption share quantity's proportion to the fund's total share quantity. The resulting percentage is the proportion of the redemption share quantity due as the redeeming investor's Performance Fee payment. This quantity is deducted from the redeeming share quantity and credited to the manager's share account balance. The remaining redeeming share quantity is destroyed as the proportionate individual token assets are transferred out of the fund and the fund's total share quantity and the investor's share quantity is reduced by this net redeeming share quantity.
